# Task 4: Configure cluster network for workloads

**Context:** You want to deploy a new high-security VM on an Azure Local cluster. You want this VM to run a network that is isolated from the host cluster network. 

**Your goal**: Configure the cluster, `azlcluster3`, so that you can deploy workloads in the following networking range: `192.168.10.2 â€“ 192.168.10.255` on `VLAN 10`.

**Details:**

- Your router is already configured with a Layer-3 Virtual Switch interface with gateway address `192.168.10.1`.
- DNS server: `192.168.1.254`
- Block all inbound traffic on this subnet.


**Stop when:** You confirm the network is setup.
