# Study Instructions

## Background

Today, you’re going to evaluate the user interface for Azure Local and the Azure portal. You’ll complete tasks that a systems administrator would do when setting up an Azure Local system, such as:

- Connecting a server node to the Azure cloud
- Deploying a 2-node cluster
- Creating a virtual machine on the cluster

## How the session works

- **Complete one task at a time.** Before you start, read the task out loud. If anything is unclear, I can help clarify.
- **Keep the task instructions handy.** If you have the screen space, open them side by side your browser. You can reference them anytime.
- **Work as you would on the job.** If the instructions do not specify a configuration (like what to name a VM), choose a name based on your professional opinion and the context provided in the task.
- **Think aloud or work silently** as you complete tasks. Try to complete tasks in a timely manner.
- **If you get stuck on a task,** you can search public documentation or use Copilot. If you feel completely blocked, let me know and we can move to the next one. I may also stop you early to stay on schedule.
- **Let me know when you’ve completed a task.** You’ll complete a short survey after each task.



## Task 0 
- **Log into Azure portal.** Open a new private browser window. Log into azure using the temporary account credentails that were sent to you. Dismiss any Azure popups that come up.
