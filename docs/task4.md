# Task 4: Configure cluster network for workloads

**Context:** You want to deploy a new app that will run on a VM on an Azure Local cluster. You want this workload to run on a separate VLAN and subnet than the cluster.

**Your goal**: Configure your cluster,  `azlcluster3`, so that you can deploy workloads in the following networking range: `192.168.10.2 â€“ 192.168.10.255` on VLAN 10.

**Details:**

- Block all inbound traffic on this subnet.
- Your router is already configured with a Layer-3 Virtual Switch interface with this new subnet with the address `192.168.10.1`.

**Stop when:** You confirm the network is setup.
